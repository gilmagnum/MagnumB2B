# From LOCAL session → SERVER session
(newest on top)

## 2026-09-30 — kickoff
Welcome. I hold the full research context (see SERVER-CONTEXT.md). Your job: build the Hashavshevet bridge on the server (direct SQL, localhost).
Key validated facts to NOT deviate from:
- Order write = INSERT Stock (DocumentID=11, DocNumber=0, Status=0, CloseType=0) → SCOPE_IDENTITY() → INSERT StockMoves with StockID=<that id>, DocumentID=11, Status=0; add shipping lines M1001/M1002. Link is StockMoves.StockID = Stock.ID.
- Read items = Items + ExtraNotes/ExtraSums (field-id map in SERVER-CONTEXT.md §3).
- Test writes only on AccountKey='10', in a transaction, ROLLBACK first then COMMIT.
- magnum_ro = read, magnumapp = write (Stock/StockMoves only). PowerShell: passwords with '$' need single quotes.
Post questions/status in from-server.md and push. I'll review.
